    "Simple moving average, which we will refer to as SMA, is a basic technical analysis indicator. The simple moving average, as you may have guessed from its name, is computed by adding up the price of an instrument over a certain period of time divided by the number of time periods. It is basically the price average over a certain time period, with equal weight being used for each price. The time period over which it is averaged is often referred to as the lookback period or history."

    "The EMA is similar to the simple moving average, but, instead of weighing all prices in the history equally, it places more weight on the most recent price observation and less weight on the older price observations. This is endeavoring to capture the intuitive idea that the new price observation has more up-to-date information than prices in the past. It is also possible to place more weight on older price observations and less weight on the newer price observations. This would try to capture the idea that longer-term trends have more information than short-term volatile price movements.\n",
    "The weighting depends on the selected time period of the EMA; the shorter the time period, the more reactive the EMA is to new price observations; in other words, the EMA converges to new price observations faster and forgets older observations faster, also referred to as Fast EMA. The longer the time period, the less reactive the EMA is to new price observations; that is, EMA converges to new price observations slower and forgets older observations slower, also referred to as Slow EMA.\n",
    "Based on the description of EMA, it is formulated as a weight factor, U  , applied to new price observations and a weight factor applied to the current value of EMA to get the new value of EMA. Since the sum of the weights should be 1 to keep the EMA units the same as price units, that is, $s, the weight factor applied to EMA values turns out to be 1-U  . Hence, we get the following two formulations of new EMA values based on old EMA values and new price observations, which are the same definitions, written in two different forms:\n",

    "Bollinger bands is a well-known technical analysis indicator developed by John Bollinger. It computes a moving average of the prices (you can use the simple moving average or the exponential moving average or any other variant). In addition, it computes the standard deviation of the prices in the lookback period by treating the moving average as the mean price. It then creates an upper band that is a moving average, plus some multiple of standard price deviations, and a lower band that is a moving average minus multiple standard price deviations. This band represents the expected volatility of the prices by treating the moving average of the price as the reference price. Now, when prices move outside of these bands, that can be interpreted as a breakout/trend signal or an overbought/sold mean reversion signal.\n",

The upper and lower bands are then computed by adding/subtracting to , which is the product of standard deviation,sigma, which we've seen before, and beta, which is a standard deviation factor of our choice.
